## Notes:
This project was made to try a different style of game after PlatformerGL, with the main objective of
trying to get text rendering in the game. It was a nuissance, but I think I got everything down. I'm
looking to extend this text rendering method into a future library, so the code doesn't need to be
remade everytime I make a project.
## Demonstration

## Usage:
To demo the product, download the repository as a zip and navigate to the "spaceShump.zip" file. Unzip it, then within it, run the spaceShump.jar file. If you have trouble running the jar, try running it from console by typing "java -jar spaceShump.jar" in the same directory as the jar. <b>Make sure you unzip the file first before running the jar,
  otherwise the resources will not load.</b>
